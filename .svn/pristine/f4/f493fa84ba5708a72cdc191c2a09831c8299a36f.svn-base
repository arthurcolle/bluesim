Bluesim meeting

over the weekend we prototyped/reviewed the sim.js and visualgo code
this meeting focused on 
	reviewing the work done on each prototype over the weekend
		sim.js
			created a 3-way splitter
			shows the ease in creating a new objects
			see the flow of the code
			all of the sim.js code is copied into queue-min.js
			codebase is small!
		visualgo
			awesome d3 frontend
			purtilo likes the grpahics of the site
the goal is to pick one of these demo's and use them as a spring board
problem with sim.js
	need to expand the functionality.. a lot
		generators need to have different types
		generator data need to be combined into complex types
		branches need to be smarter
			they should be based off of fields
		we should be able to apply functions on the data as well
		generators should use different probability functions
	ANIMATIONS - yeah non-existent
		D3 looks good though
		we can replace the raphael library with d3 and then move from there
problem with visualgo
	huge codebase

decision as of now: we are going to build up from the sim.js demo
we will present to Purtilo our current plan and take his advice
for the meeting wednesday
	update the team on today's decision
	draft a proposal to show to Purtilo on Thursday
	determine a modular approach to the design
	divide up the work
