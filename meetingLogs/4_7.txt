Bluesim meeting

We discussed some more design points because there was debate about the use of the custom objects, to summarize:
	There is only one global object instead of allowing each source to be an object
		this approach will be less prone to errors
		we cannot think of a specific example that would require us to allow the user to have many custom objects at once
	Object creation is determined in the source or inherently in the object definition
		while there is a nice division in putting the distributions and parameters that fill in the fields of the custom objects
		we greatly limit the complexity of the custom objects if we only allow them to be edited in their object definition
		instead, we only define the fields of the object
		within each source, the distribution and parameters of each field are instantiated
			oh and the type of the field can also be declared in the object
We have reviewed work on the proposal
	we need to push this out asap
	we spent most of the meeting discussing the proposal and writing parts of it
	the plan is to write most of it on our own and then come to the meeting on wednesday to polish the paper together
	submit the proposal to Purtilo asap and then get ready for him to reject it and want certain revision
