Bluesim meeting

Administrative Things:
	everyone can meet at this time on Wednesdays
	we will add more meetings as needed
	everyone is on slack (so that's good)
	Spring Break is coming up
		we will not meet over spring break but everyone will have some presence on slack
	no one has much opinion on how to operate on svn repo
		just work directly with trunk until we get problems

Plan to meet Purtilo tomorrow at 9:30 to discuss more about the project
	needs more clarification before we can make a definite design
	we will meet him before class and schedule more meetings later in the day as needed

Examples we think we should be able to model (for validation and presenting)
	predator-prey
	game of life

Questions for Purtilo when we meet tomorrow:
	what are the inputs to the simulation?
	who is the audience?
	how should the user interface with the software?
	deliverables?
	(we will think of more outside of the meeting)
	going to setup a google doc for everyone to contribute to 

Deadlines
	dependent on Purtilo's answers after tomorrows meetings
	hard deadline: finalize design by the end of March
	hard deadline: finish proposal first week of April
	soft deadline: finish code a week in advance to allow for testing/debugging
